This week I used a combination of “I can identify and employ technologies related to content management” and “I can find and use resources for self directed learning”. In our group Ethan and I assessed and added plugins for our website to make the website building process go more smoothly. On Friday after going around all the groups one of the biggest problems seemed to be getting blocks to line up next to each other so I spent some time looking up how to do that using wordpress. Although, I didn’t really find a good solution besides adding more plugins.
