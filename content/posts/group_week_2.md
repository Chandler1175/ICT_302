This week, our group has accomplished setting up our Hugo site, setting up our Netlify, adding everyone to the Github directory and the newly created Microsoft Teams channel. We've also decided on our topic, weâ€™re considering the topic of our website being a cafe/bookstore. Communication and cooperation among the team is going well. The next steps we're going to take will be brainstorming what is exactly needed on our website and the initial layout draft.
