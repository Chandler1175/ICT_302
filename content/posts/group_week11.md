This week our group made a lot of progress on our website. Grace found most of the pictures for each of our pages and changed some of the layout for the website. Ethan and Chandler created a block so that the pictures for the pages wouldnâ€™t all be the same and created our social media/contact us page. Kaitlyn and Taylor continue to create content for our website. Our group has been doing very well communicating with each other and moving forward on the progress of our website.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89547157/140666613-d1fb8958-072a-4ba9-8ec9-1855ccaf5ef4.png)
