This week I used the "I can identify and define key concepts in web content management". I did this by looking at plugins that would help us structure our pages the way we wanted to. For example, two plugins I found were FormNinja and Google Maps, I decided to use these as we needed a payment form and a way to show our business on a map. This would help the website greatly in terms of functionality and look.
