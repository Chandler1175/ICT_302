This week I worked on describing and comparing content management systems. I learned some new features on WordPress such as the grouping function and the color background function. These functions are not avaliable on Hugo to my knowledge and I am learning that WordPress can do more advandanced tasked. I also learned how to do a featured image which I do not believe you can do on Hugo.
