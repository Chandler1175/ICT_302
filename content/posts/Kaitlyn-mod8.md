This week, I employed the "I can identify and manage content using established workflows" by discussing with my team and the other team member designated as the other editor about what plugins we would need, possible themes for the site, and establishing a workflow for our logo. The site planner will create the logo, the other editor and I will use the logo for specific photos, then we'll hand off the logo and photos to the back-end to make sure they get uploaded and implemented properly.
