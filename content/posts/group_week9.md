This week our group started working on a workflow and refining it. Our content creators have begun making content outside of wordpress and sharing it with the developers who can then start applying it to the website. We have been able to organize our content by each page of the website. By using google docs we have an outline for each page that we can all edit and mark things off the list as we finish applying it to the site. Along with microsoft teams we are able to share content amongst the group with ease. So far this is working well for us and I'm sure we will continue to flesh out the workflow as we move forward. One thing that was a problem this week was connecting to the WordPress site and then restarting once we got a more reliable WordPress instance.  Luckily we didn't have too much work on the local WordPress site.
