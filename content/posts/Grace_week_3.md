This week our group offically decided that we are doing a cafe with a bookstore for our webiste. I can strongly say that "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management." I finally can make a post on Github without any issues. I also figured out that we are using Wordpress to create our website and not Github. WordPress is a content management system, but Github is a web-based platform whih has other features to help build our website.
