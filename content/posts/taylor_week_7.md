During the week, I successfully “identified and employed technologies relating to content management”. Last week, we began to work with WordPress and one of our activities during class was to install WordPress locally. I was unable to do that successfully last week. However, this week I worked to make sure that I was able to have that downloaded for my personal use outside of this class. I am also starting to understand how WordPress works. To be honest, I was quite confused at first when we started, and I did not even understand what I was looking at. This week, it is starting to click and make more sense in terms of how we access it through Chandler’s IP address through the user accounts that we set up on his computer. I am becoming more confident in using this content management technology and I hope that my skills will continue to grow as I use WordPress more.
