This week, I was able to begin to learn how to “describe and compare content management systems”. By doing our weekly group and individual posts, I feel familiar with the basic functions of Hugo. Of course, there is still more to learn, but I am feeling more and more confident each week with constructing my posts efficiently and uploading files. This week, we jumped into WordPress and it was a learning curve at first. Just downloading it seemed like a challenge but then on Friday, I experimented with reconstructing the Daybreak Contracting Site. It was difficult at first, but with time, I will get the hang of it, just like I did with uploading posts to the Hugo site.
