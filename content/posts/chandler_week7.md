This week Mesam and I discussed how to set up our workflow to effectively manage all the content from the class groups. “I can manage content using established workflow,” is closely related to what I did this week. I did this by helping set up our workflow and continuing to add students to their groups in the teams channel to continue finishing up the workflow. Not much actual content has been sent through the workflow, but I have a solid understanding of how to set it up and what it will look like once we do start sending content through the process.
