This week I found resources for self directed learning. I continued learning about using custom simple css in order to replicate some of the style and transitions on the daybreak site. I learned that the transitions used on the main page are from the Elementor plugin. The css showing for each image was the border and alignment of the images. I think I can find something close or at least a hover effect and link to the page.
