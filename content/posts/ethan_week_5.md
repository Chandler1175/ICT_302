This week in my group we focused pretty hard on the config.toml in GitHub and testing out ways to create a main menu on our Hugo website. This job will mainly fall to Chandler and I as developers to figure out. Working in GitHub on this menu can relate to the “I can identify and define key concepts in web content management.”. I think it relates to this so much because we have to choose which pages we want to include and how we should set them up on the page. These key pages directly fall in line with our concepts of how we want the website set up and our menu will mirror that.
