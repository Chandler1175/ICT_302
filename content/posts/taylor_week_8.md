This week I was able to successfully “find and use resources for self-directed learning”. The tasks that we are assigned to complete via WordPress are not coming as easily as I thought they would. I am particularly finding myself frustrated on Fridays when we are redesigning the Day Break Contracting website. I am finding myself frustrated more times than I would like to admit, and I have to use other sources to walk myself through my problems. I have turned to https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/ for a lot of help it terms of grasping a basic understanding of WordPress Sandbox and the basic functions. YouTube has also been my friend in terms of understanding how to insert plug-ins and walking me through the basic functionality of what a block is and how to utilize its features. Overall, this week I have learned that it is okay to Google what I don’t know and ask for help when I need to.
