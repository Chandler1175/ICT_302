This week, I began to work on identifying and defining the first “I can” statement. I learned about the term content and what it meant in relation to this class. Content must have a clear editorial process and a human factor. I also heard (virtually) from two community partners about how they apply content to their companies. I never thought of hold messages to be content, but they do go through an editorial process and have a human factor, so they do meet the qualifications. I also worked firsthand with creating my own content through this post. I enjoyed working with my group to set up Hugo and GitHub and discussing how we will each play a role in the frontend and backend sides of the website.
