This week, we figured out exactly how to access the WordPress site through the IP address by switching the site address setting from local host to IP address. Once we made sure that everyone was able to gain access to the site, we renamed and added pages to fit the plan we set in the Group Contract and spent time familiarizing ourselves with how WordPress works. We finished off with discussing what next steps need to be taken and who would be doing what. Communication and cooperation is going really well, though we believe progress towards getting started with our website could be better.
