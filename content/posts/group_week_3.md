This week, our group finalized our topic for the Word-Press Website Project. We are choosing to create a website for a cafe that is located inside of a bookstore. Also, we created a name for this cafe which will be "Wildcat Cafe". Our group successfully drafted an initial contract for our website as well. In this contract, we established our pages which will be included on the website. We collaborated as a team to decide what these pages should look like and what they should include. We also constructed guidelines as to what qualifications the letter grades should meet.
