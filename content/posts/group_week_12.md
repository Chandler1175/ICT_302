This week our group is in the process of getting the content all on the site and polishing as much as possible. Our developers have added the content to all the pages and our site manager has added the pictures and is finishing the aesthetic and theme of the page. We have followed the outline we have laid out on google docs and it has been extremely helpful in organizing and keeping track of what has been done on the page. Microsoft Teams has also been a great tool we have used to communicate what we need to do and any other information. Going forward we need to polish and check the content of the page to make sure there are no grammatical or spelling mistakes. We also need to solve an issue with how to overlay images and put a gif/video on the site.
