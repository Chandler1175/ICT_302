This week I worked on managing content through “the use of established workflows”.  Our group is doing a great job with managing our assigned tasks to further the progress of our webpage. I specifically was assigned the task to complete one full page of content to further the workflow along. I was able to successfully write the content for the “Contact Page” and “Application Page”. I then assisted in other areas of the workflow on Wednesday in class and helped put some of that content onto the WordPress site.
