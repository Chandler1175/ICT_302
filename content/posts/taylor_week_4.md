In week 4, I made steps to begin to be able to "manage content using established workflow". Though Madeline Greenhalgh’s interview, I saw how a successful workflow ran in an established company. I can see how aspects of our class will mirror her company’s workflow and the interview and class discussion was a great introduction to help our group establish our own workflow. Our group decided that we will have two editors, two developers, and one site planner. I will take the role as editor. I also did some team coordination this week to communicate with my team members this week via Microsoft Teams who were absent. By beginning to establish a successful group workflow early on, our group will be able to manage content on our website using an establish workflow later on.
