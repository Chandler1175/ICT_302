This week I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. I can do this because I came across Canva and Adobe Spark that help me create the logo for our website. I chose to use Canva because it was simple and basic. On Friday, when working on the DayBreak Contracting website we are trying to fix the pictures. I am still trying to figure out how to work that website and feel more comfortable with it. Next week, I'm hoping to have at least 2 or 3 pages down for "Wildcat Caf√©."
