This week, "I can identify and employ technologies realated to content management." I can do this because of teaching myself how to use WordPress. I'm not familar with WordPress at all yet, so I messed around with the website. Since my job is the site planner I browsed the different themes and messed around with them to get familar with it. For next week when using WordPress, I hope I can be 100% comfortable with it.
