This week, "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management." I can do this because I tried to help Taylor a little bit on finding a website to edit our merchandise on. I also went back and changed our logo on Canva to fit on our on merchandise if needed. I picked out a theme "accelerate" for our website. For next, I will have most of the pictures done for our website.
