This week I was able to find and use resources to employ self directed learning on WordPress. With the help of the fencing group and a little bit of personal research, I was able to employ and impliment a custom html to set up a white block on the Gutters page for the Daybreak site. This was very confusing and frusterating to me at first and I personally did not understand how to impliiment custom html into WordPress but wiith a little bit of experience, I am now able to use it in a variety of places throughout the Gutters page which is starting to help solve several roadblocks that I was having.
