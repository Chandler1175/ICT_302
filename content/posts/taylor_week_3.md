In week 3, I completed several tasks that helped me confidently “identify and employ technologies related to content management”. First, I learned how to embed a pdf to a Hugo website. At first, I made a mistake, but though asking questions, I can now confidently say that I can independently complete the task. I learned that a file must exist somewhere on in internet to be accessible on a website. I had to upload the pdf to the content posts folder on GitHub first and then link the pdf. I am also feeling more confident with the basic functions of GitHub. I make less mistakes when uploading posts to Hugo and create posts faster. I believe that these skills will help me overall be more successful when we go to start creating content on our Word-Press websites.
