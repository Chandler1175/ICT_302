This week I was able to further describe and compare content management systems. I mentioned in my Personal Learning Report that I wanted to further improve on this "I can" statement so this week, I talked to Dr. Greenhalgh about how to further develop my knowledge and understanding on this particular area. I determined that WordPress is overall more accressable and widley used so it is easier to find plugins, widgets, and infomration on how to use the software. Hugo is less widely used, so even though plugins are avaliable, the are far less. For example, I have not even worked with plugins on Hugo nor am I farmilar with how they function. The need for them for our projects in this particular class on Wordpress has been far more nesscessary.
