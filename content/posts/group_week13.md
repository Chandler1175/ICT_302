This week, our group has been working to polish the layout of our site. We managed to fix extra white space on the pages, get a working header, changed some design aspects, and rearranged the menu. We're still struggling with fixing the header to have the top image properly overlaid, getting the header to stretch to fit the width of the page, and finding images that fit with the needs of our site. Going forward, we'll play around with the site to see if we can make it a bit more visually appealing, fix the layout of the merch page, and solve the current issues we're struggling with.
