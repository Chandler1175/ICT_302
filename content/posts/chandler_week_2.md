During this week I learned what content is and how it's used.  Content is a piece of work that goes through an editorial process and is intended for human consumption. We also discussed the relationship between frontend and backend development to create content as a whole. A person needs to be able to understand and do both to get a good finished product. A quick summary would be the frontend is the end result the users see and the backend is the technical side that the users won't see. The work we have done setting up Github, Hugo, Netlify and Microsoft teams has been good for seeing the differences of the content management systems we are using. Because of this I feel that I can describe and compare content management systems as well as identify and employ technologies related to content management.
