This week as a group we completed our contract and layed out the plan for the website. We discussed different technologies we could incorporate in the website as well as the aesthetic we want to have. This week I was able to find resources for self directed learning by using resources from previous classes like Zotero to save ideas and features we want to incorporate in the finished product.
