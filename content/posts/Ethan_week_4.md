This week my group heavily focused on defining roles and establishing how our page should look and how each role accomplishes this. This relates very heavily to the identify and define key concepts in web management. By determining roles and how they should be done, we are identifying the key concepts and functions that go into web design and how they should be done for our own website. These key concepts in web content management that weâ€™re identifying for our roles will benefit us greatly going forward into our project.
