This week, I was able to “find and use resources for self-directed learning”. When watching the assigned video titled “15 Big Companies that Surprisingly Use WordPress”, I was a confused when plugins were mentioned. More specifically, the video mentioned that several companies were using the Yoast SEO plugin. Instead of just brushing the term off, I decided to do some research to find out what that plugin did. It turns out that many large companies that use WordPress sites will use that specific plug in. They use it because it improves the website’s rankings on search engines by optimizing the site’s content and keywords. By finding this article and doing a little bit of research, I was able to conduct self-directed learning.
