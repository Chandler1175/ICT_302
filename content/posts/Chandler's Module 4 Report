This week our group got together to decide what roles everyone will take. Luckily it seems like everyone was able to get something they wanted. We also set up our microsoft planner page for the group so we can assign tasks and things we want to get done. I feel like I have  a better understanding of establishing workflows, but while we set them up we havenâ€™t used them much yet so I still have a bit of experience to get before I can confidently say I can manage content using established workflows, but there's a good start and our group so far has been good at communicating.
