This week I continued using self directed learning, as well as, managing content using an established workflow. I found out how to get Google maps with help from professor Greenhalgh. Once he mentioned an embedded link I looked up how to find the embedded html and put it on our WordPress. This allowed me and Ethan to finish applying content to one of our pages and continue on with other parts of the website. Following our workflow we have been able to maintain good communication and get a lot of our work done this week.
