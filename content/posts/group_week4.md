This week, our group got together to decide what roles everyone in the group would take to help make the website building go smoother. We went with the structure that was discussed in class monday. We have two developers, two editors, one site planner. We opted to leave out the administrator and stakeholder roles because those roles wouldn't be very useful in this sense. We believe weâ€™ll have a bit of overlap, so the roles are mainly just guidelines for now. As a group we also set up a microsoft planner page for the team so we can organize our work better.
