 This week my group did a lot of planning for our website and identifying what web content management tools we could use to structure our website with on each page. I learned this week what what web content management tools we could use and being able to apply them made me think of how differently you can use things like pictures, links, text, etc. Through the use of these tools, we can make our website easily navigated, structured, and overall a very easy website to use.
