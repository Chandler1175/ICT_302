This week, our group continued to make progress with designing and producing content for our Wildcat Caf√© website. In class on Wednesday, we had some difficulties accessing WordPress through the server. However, our group worked around the issue and continued to make progress. Kaitlyn and I worked on writing and organizing content. Grace designed a logo and Chandler and Ethan found plug-ins that will be useful for formatting our content. Our group continues to display great communication and this week, we worked towards establishing a plan for a concreate workflow. We all have also been doing a great job with showing up for class on group workdays and reliability. Next week, we aim to get some of our content up on our WordPress site, which is something we are lacking in at the moment.
